# Tableau: Retailer food waste in Downtown Brooklyn

This project utilized Tableau to create a dashboard for analyzing retailer food waste in downtown Brooklyn. The analysis focused on four food types (packaged, shelf stable, perishable, ready-to-eat) and six retailer types (bakery/deli, chain grocer, coffee shop, counter service, drugstore, health food grocer).

The dashboard explored the impact of label type (package printed and sticker labels) and retailer type on the type of food that was wasted. 

The interactive dashboard provided insights into the relationship between retailer types, food types, and labels and served as a powerful tool for communicating findings and facilitating data-driven decision-making to address food waste challenges effectively.
